# Daemons Repository

This repository contains multiple daemon scripts designed for network automation and monitoring tasks. Each script serves a specific purpose to help automate network-related processes, ensuring your systems are up-to-date and accessible.

## Overview of Daemons

### Daemon List

1. **No-IP DDNS Updater Daemon** (Python)

   - The **No-IP DDNS Updater Daemon** is a Python script that automatically updates your No-IP Dynamic DNS (DDNS) entry with your current public IP address. It checks for active internet connectivity and updates your No-IP configuration as needed, ensuring that your hostname is always updated with your public IP. This allows consistent remote access to your devices even if your IP address changes.
   - **Features**: Internet connectivity check, public IP retrieval, No-IP DDNS update.
   - **Configuration**: Requires a `config.json` file with No-IP credentials.
   - [Detailed Documentation](./PyNoIpDDNS/README.md)

This repository is a collection, and more daemon scripts will be added to automate a variety of network and system management tasks. Each daemon has its own specific README file that explains its configuration, usage, and purpose in detail.

## General Requirements

- **Python 3.x** (for Python scripts)
- **Required Modules or Dependencies**: Specific dependencies are noted in each script's README file.

To install the necessary dependencies, use the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each script may require specific configurations, such as JSON files or environment variables, which are clearly outlined in their respective documentation.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh

3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure the required dependencies are installed and any necessary configuration files are set up.

4. **Run the Script**: Run the script as described in its individual README.

## Error Handling and Logging

Each daemon script includes error handling mechanisms to manage configuration errors, connectivity issues, and other potential problems. Error messages are logged to help troubleshoot issues if they arise.
